# SimpleCalculator-MadeinC-

Simple calculator made in C++, it uses either the elseif method or the switch statements which can be selected from the console itself; yes it's a console application and a basic calculator. The graphical version is coming out soon, hope you enjoy as I have put the executable file as well as the project files with the codes inside.
